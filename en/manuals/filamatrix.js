                    <p class='extra-space'>This manual is designed to provide additional information and context specific to the FilamATrix modification for the Stealthburner. It serves as a supplementary resource to the official <a href="https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/blob/main/Manual/Assembly_Manual_SB.pdf" target="_blank">Voron Stealthburner manual</a> and is intended to be used alongside it. While following the same general assembly procedure outlined in the official manual, this guide highlights the key differences and unique considerations for incorporating the FilamATrix modification into your build.</p>
