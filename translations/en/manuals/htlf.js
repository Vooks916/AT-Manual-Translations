                    <p>This is NOT a <a href="https://vorondesign.com/" target="_blank">VORON Design</a> project, we strongly recommend that you run a profile that is specific to HTLF. Voron parts profiles are not recommended for HTLF printed parts, as the tolerance expectations are different.</p>
                    <p class="extra-space">Specifically, make sure you are tuning for skew and filament shrinkage. An excellent tool for this is Vector3D's <a href="https://vector3d.shop/products/califlower-calibration-tool-mk2" target="_blank">Califlower Mk2</a> (yes, it's worth the $14). Do this <i>before</i> you print ~0.5kg worth of filament for HTLF parts!</p>

                    <p>These are the print settings we recommend you follow in order to have the best chance at success with your parts. Note: Parts with an interference fit on metal components have a tolerance of 0.15mm, and all printed part interfaces have a tolerance of 0.2mm. Check your profile for dimensional accuracy accordingly.</p>
